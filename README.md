# Warfork Gametypes

## About

This is my (unfinished, potentially broken) collection of gametype scripts I work on for the game Warfork.

## Gametypes

- Spin (player rotates at all times)
  - SpinFFAA (Spin Free-for-All Arena)
  - SpinCA (Spin Clan Arena)
  - Spinsta (Spin Instagib)
  - Spinduel (Spin Duel)
- SoulSwap (Teleport to the person you killed)
  - SoulSwap (regular CA, except you teleport to the person you fragged, keeping their momentum and lookangle)
  - rdmswap (RDM, but with same mechanic as described above)
- Party (Randomized "Party"-style gametype, minigames)
- KOTA (King of the Arena, unbalanced teams. Highest avg. damage dealing players on the King team, which is significantly smaller than the opposing team)
- highasf (start off floating at the top of the map, low gravity/velocity, less health you have = less you float)
- blessedca (Clan Arena, but blessed :\>)
- gungame (FFA-based gametype where players upgrade their weapon by killing an enemy)
- zoomer (RDM scoring, but clan arena)
- VampFFAA (Vampiric FFAA, you gain health for damage dealt to an enemy)
